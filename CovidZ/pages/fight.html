<pre>You look around you for something that you can use as a weapon. On the footpath
you see the left over from last nights local wino gathering. You pick up a empty
beer bottle, smash it off the wall to leave you with a makeshift weapon</pre>pre>

<pre>
"Don't come any closer", you shout. " I have a weapon and am not afraid to use it.
The man ignores you and keeps walking towards you. When he is close enough,
you lunge forward, stapping him in the chest. It has no affect.
He leaps forward and bites down on your neck, ripping it open.
You fall to the ground, life blood flowing away.

DEAD. BUT FOR HOW LONG</pre>
