    <h2>Day one</h2>
    <br>
   
    <main>
    <pre>There has never been a challange that you have not over come and you are determined
    that this one will be no different. You open your front door slowly and peer out, the 
    streets seem deserted. Looking further up the street, you can see the zombie standing
    with his back to you. He is not moving giving you the perfect chance to sneak up on him
    and get that selfie. You put your phone in camera mode and carefully with a gentle gait
    walk towards him. The zombie shows no sign of hearing you. Once directly behind him, you
    stand slightly to the left to ensure both you and the zombie will be in the picture.You 
    stretch your arm around him and click on the button, the perfect selfie. Before you have
    time to withdraw your arm, the zombie lunges and clamps down. Your camera drops and smashes
    on the ground and you sream in agony. No one will ever see the selfie. You try to pull away
    but he is to strong, he knocks you to the ground and you know it is over. How stupid could
    I be, you think, a selfie with a zombie. You curse facebook, your curse yourself as you
    are slowly ripped apart. You have failed the selfie challange, you have failed CovidZ

    DEAD. BUT FOR HOW LONG
