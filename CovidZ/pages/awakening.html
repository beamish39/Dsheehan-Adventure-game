You rise of the couch for the first time that day. You had finally done it, you had beaten
the most difficult and hardest game of all time. Two weeks of constant play had finally paid off.
The timing could not have been better, college was starting back soon and you wanted to have 
finished the game before the hard grind of study started again. It had been a long strange summer,
a global pandemic had meant lockdowns and isolation but life was slowly returning to normal, well,
for normal people anyway. You enjoyed the isolation, it meant binge watching netflix with out someone
spoiling the show, day long gaming session without intruption and no unnecessary social interaction,
surviving on both frozen pizza and delivered pizza,but now it was time to pretend to be a human again.</pre>

You turn of your playstation and decide what to do next. Some excerise would be needed to work off
the weeks of pizza. You could also phone a friend and talk to a non-computer generated person for a change.
What do you decide? <a class="blood" href="walk.html">Walk</a> or <a class="blood" href="phone.html">Phone a friend</a></pre>
