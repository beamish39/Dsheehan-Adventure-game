    <h2>Day one</h2>
    <br>

    <main>
    <pre>
You pick up your phone and decide to phone Trevor. You let the phone ring three times, hang up,
 and call again. Trevor is a little bit paranoid and insists that you phone this way to prove that
 it is really you and that your phone has not been stolen and being used by someone to con him.</pre>
    
    <pre><div class="chat"> 
    Hi Trev, how's it going?" you ask.
    "Not good" he replies. " These are stange times, the signs are there".
    You know you will regret it but you ask anyway. " what signs"
    "Did you hear about the goat in Kerry, it give birth to a kid with two heads"
    "A kid", you shout. "What is gods name are they doing to the goats down there?"
    "A kid is a baby goat your moron"
    "Ah, that makes more sense, I would still not trust them with my goat,if I owned one"
    "Thats not all",he continued " You know that Harvey Norman sale, the one that has been running for 5 years,
    it's over, and, the man with the end is nigh sign, that walks up and down Patricks Street,
    he is gone, his sign just rotting in the gutter.
    I am telling you know Dan, something is coming, be prepared."
    "I guess you don't fancy meeting up then" I ask
    There is a moment of silence before he says " be prepared" and hangs up.</pre></div>
