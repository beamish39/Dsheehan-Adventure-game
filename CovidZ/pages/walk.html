<pre>Leaving the comfort of your living room, you venture outside for what seems the
first time in eternity. The bright light of the out doors brings water to your eyes.
You start walking down the street.As you look down the street, you see to figures in
the sun but it looks like one is hurt and been attended to by the other.
You consider offering help but that could
mean getting stuck in a uncomfortable situation. You could also just walk the other 
way hope that the situation is under control. Go help out <a class="blood" href="help.html">Help</a>
or <a class="blood" href="away.html">Walk away</a></pre>
