    It looks like the world has gone crazy during your 2 week game session. You look out your window
    and it looks nothing like you saw on the news. No hordes of zombies roaming the streets, just the
    one from earlier. Maybe the full effects are not being felt in Ireland yet. It could be a good 
    time to complete the covidz challange, you are sure you can handle just the one zombie, how hard
    could it be?
