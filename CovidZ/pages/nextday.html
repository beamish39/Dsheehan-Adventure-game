    <h2>Day one</h2>
    <br>
    <main>
    <pre>
    You decide that the covidz challenge is not a very smart idea at this time and you would be better
    off planning for the days ahead. You remember what the news report said about locking all doors.
    You check all doors and windows in the house to ensure nothing can get in. You then start making a list
    of what you might need to surive the coming days and weeeks. 
    </pre>
    </main>
    <br>
    <h2><ol class="list">
        <li> Food</li>
        <li> Weapons</li>
        <li> First Aid Kit</li>
    </h2>
    </ol >
    <br>

    <pre>
    The news is not good, you have none of the items on the list in the house, your two week gaming session
    meant you used up all your food. You have never bought a first aid kit, as for weapons, your game 
    contoller was  the only one you ever thought you would need. You can not surive locked in, you will
    have to leave to get supplies.  First you need a good nights sleep, because tomorrow, 
    your adventure truely begins.
